# Github and Griddle Grill

# Overview
This app was created for Chingu Voyage 50. It is a simulated restaurant webpage taking data from a menu JSON and displaying various food items. Using local memory, users are able to add these items to a cart and select a credit amount to add in order to make a "purchase".

# Features
This project includes:
- Home page/menu
- A shopping cart that holds data using local storage
- The ability to remove items from your cart
- A credit system that allows you to add "money" to make your purchase. Leftover credit is saved between purchases using local storage.
